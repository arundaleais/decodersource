This is the README file for Ais Decoder.

V143
I have written and installed a Auto-updater.
If this causes any problems, please download and install the latest version
which is:
http://arundale.com/docs/ais/AisDecoder_setup_3.4.143.exe

You must have Administrator Privileges to install AisDecoder.

There are sample template files included. I have kept these intentionally as simple
as practicable, so you can see the wood from the trees.

As the Decoder is still being developed, there will be bugs and improvements
to make, I would be pleased to hear of any suggestions. 

If you have any problems, please email me at neal@arundale.com
