Can I import a NMEA text file ?

What files does AisDecoder use ?
Look at Options > Show Files gives the physical location of (most) files

Download and install (you do not need to uninstall the previous version)
Look at Options > Show Files - which gives the physical location of (most) files
Locate the current initialisation file
Place the attached initialisation file in the same directory
In the Options Window > Click Open New > Select the attached file
 
Save the current profile first then stop AisDecoder so that I get a clean startup file with the profile you are currently using
I have a problem with AisDecoder starting
Please locate AisDecoderStartup.log and email it to me
The file should be in the %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp directory
Which dependent on your setup will be somewhere like c:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp
The folder may be hidden and search may not find the file !
This file folder can also be located  from
Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables > TEMP

Please email me the Startup Log which you can find by
Ticking Options > Show Files
and (if it is Defined) also the Error Log file

I have a problem setting up AisDecoder to do what I want to do
Please email me the .ini file you are currently using
It's location can be found from Options > Show Files
and explain what you are trying to do.

AisDecoder will not install
Please locate the file "Setup Log [install date] #[sequence no].txt and email it to me
The file should be in the %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp directory
Which dependent on your setup will be somewhere like c:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp
The folder may be hidden and search may not find the file !
This file folder can also be located  from
Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables > TEMP
Which will be in the same folder as the Startup Log (see above)

Please save the attached file as C:\temp\AisDecoder3.1.all
Then restart AisDecoder
At the moment the only difference is it will enable you to generate overlays

How do I map DAC 0 (test) to another DAC ?

1.	Exit AisDecoder completely
2.	Open TestDac.ZIP which contains 2 files 
3.	Click on TestDacOn.reg
4.	
TestDacOff.reg

If you just click on one or the other, they will automatically make/modify registry entries which will turn on or off mapping from one DAC to another.

If you open the files up with Notepad, you'll see how it works.
Any changes must be in exactly the same format.

Note the registry settings will only take effect when you next start AisDecoder.
Also you must have Administrator Privileges to invoke the Registry Editor

Initilisation file in not found
To Force an initialisation file
Open a DOs Command window
C:\Documents and Settings\jna>"%ProgramFiles%\arundale\Ais Decoder\AisDecoder.exe" /ini="c:\%appdata%\Arundale\Ais Decoder\Settings\default.ini"

When decoding large files the speed of processing becomes relevant. In particular ANY dynamic display window (Input, Output, NMEA etc) will seriously affect the processing speed.
Also only do the minimum amount of processing you need to achieve the output you require.
Use the Input filter to remove any sentence types you are not interested in.
If you are interested in only 1 MMSI use the MMSI Input filter.
Do not output any field you do not require.

The Reg file EditOptions.reg is attached which should override the Administrator Block on the Options Button.
As your virus checker will probably blows out the .reg file, the .reg file is zipped up as editoptions.zip, the Password is email (lowercase)
If you wish to verify the contents, save EditOptions.reg to disk and open with notepad.
If you still cannot get it through your firewall, let me know and I'll upload it to my website so you can FTP it.
The Reg hack needs to be in place when the program is started, as it only checks when the program is loading.
Please let me know if it now does what you wish.

Trailing @ in Text Fields - Changed in V136 (corrections in V137)

If a text field (including vessel names) has been filled with Nulls (@) rather than spaces when the text was created by the vessel sending the message, the vessel name will be "Vessel Name@@@@@@"

For clarity, I used to remove any trailing @ but is was pointed out to me that this is contrary to the ITU specification for text fields, which is why I have altered it, otherwise a user cannot see what was actually transmitted.

In a text field, a null (@) should now be displayed as @ EXCEPT when the vessel name is cached. When the vessel name is cached any trailing spaces and any trailing @ will be removed for clarity. No other text fields will be reformatted by changing @ to space or truncating the field length.

However in the actual decoded vessel name field (msg 5 & 24) the @ will NOT be removed, so a user can see what is actually transmitted.

There is also a very specific case where if a text field is filled with 6 bits to ensure the message length is on an 8 bit boundary then the text message will have one @ appended to it, even if one was not transmitted. This is a peculiarity caused by the way text fields have been implemented by the ITU.

If you wan	t to remove trailing @ for display purposes then that is up to you, but bear in mind the @ symbol is also a valid text character. So if the vessel's name was me@mydomain.com the @ should still be rendered.

Is it possible to suppress the rejection of NMEA AIS sentences where the NMEA fill character count (before the *) is over 5.
Attached is a Zip file containing a NmeaFillBitsError.zip file which contains two files.
DisableNmeaFillBitsError.reg	- Suppresses rejection of Nmea Fill Bit errors
EnableNmeaFillBitsError.reg	- Re-enables error checking
(note: Virus scanners will reject the .reg file)
If you click the .reg file Windows will activate the registry editor which make a registry entry that will disable/enable checking in V143 onwards.

To find the error.log file (only created if there have been any reportable errors)
1.    Get a DOS command prompt
2.    Type set appdata
3.    The directory location of %APPDATA% is displayed and will be something like
        C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data
4.    The error.log file is created in %APPDATA% \Arundale\Ais Decoder\Logs\ and will be something like
        C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data\Arundale\Ais Decoder\Logs\error.log

1.	Right click on installer after download to file. Select “Troubleshoot compatibility”, then “Try recommended settings”

2.	Installing as administrator (if its not) , and (on windows 7, when you click to run the program, right click and disable UAC (user access control).
	
3.	When trying to enter FTP password

The baud rate detection works by looking for a <CR><LF> bit stream (0000110100001010)
The maximum length of a valid NMEA data sentence is 82 characters including the mandatory <CR><LF> sentence terminator. It will continue cycling until this is found.
Some devices, incorrectly, do not output a <CR><LF> terminator (for example raspberry pi or SDR chips incorrectly programmed; or serial to network converters outputting UDP datagrams without requiring a <CR><LF> terminator).
