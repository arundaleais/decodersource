<h3>Getting Started</h3>

Ais Decoder has a large number of options to enable you to output decoded AIS data for your own purposes.<br>
I would suggest you start by setting up the input so you can see you are receiving valid data<br>
Once you can see valid data, try changing some of the options.<br>
I have supplied a number of initialisation files which hold pre-set settings, these enable you to see how you can tailor the output to suit various requirements.
