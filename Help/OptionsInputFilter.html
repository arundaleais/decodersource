    <h3>Options - Input Filter</h3>
    For a NMEA sentence to pass through the filter, it has to reach the
    end of a number of checks. A message failing at one level will fail
    completely.<br>
    <br>

    </div>
    <br>
    <b>Reject Shore Stations</b> (if ticked) will reject any MMSI's
    starting with 00.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MyShip</b> (if ticked) will NOT reject AIS !AIVDO sentences.
    These sentences are NOT transmitted by a vessels AIS transponder but
    are present on the vessels NMEA bus. The vessels position will be
    transmitted as a !AIVDM sentence. Typically !AIVDO sentences contain
    the vessels position. this is so a Chart Plotter (or AisDecoder)
    used on a vessel can differentiate between MyShip and other Ships.<br>
    AisDecoder uses !AIVDO to output MyShip's position and the range and
    bearing of other ships from MyShip.<br>
    <br>
    Each level is indented (to the right) from the previous level. When
    you tick one level, if there are any more levels, you will be
    presented with another set of tick boxes. If you do not tick any
    boxes on any one level, the whole of the level will be removed, in
    which case all messages ticked on the previous level will be
    accepted. You do not have to tick sub items - they are assumed to be
    ticked.<br>
    <br>
    If a binary message is selected (see message 6 above) the tick boxes
    will expand (as required) to allow you select the DAC, followed by
    the Function, and if applicable the Function Identifier. <br>

        src="pics/ais_decoder_v3_options_inputfilter_mmsi.gif"><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">At the bottom of the filter there
        is the option to accept only messages sent <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">from</span> a number of specified
        MMSI, and/or <span style="font-weight: bold;">to</span> a
        number of specified MMSI's.<br>

        Some NMEA $ sentences may be filtered. If <b>only</b> NMEA $
        Sentences is ticked, all NMEA sentences will be output. The GPS
        NMEA sentences $GPZDA, $GPGGA and &amp; $GPRMC sentences are
        decoded and their values available for tagging. These may be
        used (for example) to extract NMEA time stamps.<br>

        The complete Filter tree is displayed on the <a>Control/Stats
          Window</a>, with all redundant options removed. Only sentences
        at the ends of each branch will be allowed through for output.
        In the above example it will be all AIS and NMEA $ sentences.<br>
