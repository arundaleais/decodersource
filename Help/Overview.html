<h3>Overview</h3>

All ships over 300 tons as well as many smaller ships continuously
transmit messages giving their position principally for collision
avoidance.<br>
<br>
These messages can be received by an AIS receiver, however to produce meaningful information they need decoding.<br>
<br>
AisDecoder outputs meaningful information, in a variety of formats, by decoding the data output from a dedicated AIS receiver, or from a network
