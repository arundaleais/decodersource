<h3>GIS Button</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 60px; height: 46px;"

</div>
Pressing the GIS button, will display the current Tagged Output file
using the application associated with the file extension.<br>
<br>
For example,
if the output file extension is .KML, Google Earth will be used to
display the output file,&nbsp; provided KML is set as the default
program to run using explorer.<br>
<br>
If the current output file was an HTML
file, the current default browser will be used to render the HTML file.<br>
<br>
The button is only enabled after a new Tagged file has been created
after the Start button has been pressed. It is also disabled
temporarily during creation of a new output file by the
Scheduler.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
All Tags will be listed in the Output Tags and Range list. This shows a
list of those you will most probably want to output for GIS. Note for
all vessels the corresponding Field Tag list will contain approx 50
Tagged Fields. <br>
