<p>If multiple copies of AisDecoder are running on the same device (PC)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Input Restrictions</span></p>

<p>The Network input port must be unique for each copy. For an exception see <a
href="#TCP">TCP</a> below.</p>

<p>You cannot use the same input port UDP for input on the same PC even if it
is using a broadcast IP address (eg 192.168.1.255)</p>

<p>You can also run AisDecoder on the same PC if using <a name="TCP"
id="TCP"><span style="font-weight:bold;">TCP</span></a> for input from the same
server using the same port provided the server allows multiple connections to
the same IP address. This depends on the configuration on the server. This is
permissible because the specified port is only used to make the initial
connection following which the sever and client (your PC), negotiate a
mutuallly agreed free port. Suppliers of AIS data over the internet are
unlikely to allow multiple connections (at no charge) due to server loading
issues.</p>

<p>If multiple copies of AisDecoder are running on different devices on the
same local network:-</p>

<p>You can use the same port for UDP if is using the broadcast address (eg
192.168.1.255) <span style="font-weight:bold;">and</span> AisDecoder is running
on a different PC on the same local network.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">File Restrictions</span></p>

<p>I have introduced a versioning naming convention to try and resolve output
file name conflicts.</p>

<p>If AisDecoder detects a file is already in use it will add a version number
by appending ;nnn to the file name immediately prior to the first extension
name dot.</p>

<p>eg if the first file name is nmea.log the second will be nmea;1.log</p>

<p>This will only occur if the program cannot open the second file due to it
being already in use.</p>

<p>If Cache Vessel Names is ticked on the Options window, AisDecoder will
update the disk copy of these names from memory both hourly and when AisDecoder
is terminated. When AisDecoder is started, AisDecoder reads the disk file into
memory. Any new names received while AisDecoder is running will only be updated
in memory.</p>

<p>This can result in vessel names received by one of two copies of AisDecoder
running simultaneously not being updated on disk.</p>
