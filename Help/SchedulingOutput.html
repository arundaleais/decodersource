    The functional diagram above shows the longest path messages may
    take before being output. Dependant on your options, messages may
    miss any or all of the possible stages.<br>
    <br>
    The Scheduler outputs messages in batches at timed intervals in MMSI
    number order. This allows the data from different AIS message types
    to be combined together by Vessel. For example, static vessel data
    such as Length, Beam, Call Sign are transmitted in a different
    message and at different intervals to navigational data such as
    Latitude, Longitude. Speed or Course.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 127px; height:
        81px;" alt="" src="pics/ais_decoder_v3_options_scheduler.gif"><br>
    </div>
    The data from these different messages are combined together in one
    decoded output for the one vessel, which could be one line of CSV
    data, or one entry in a tagged file.<br>
    <br>
    AIS messages are held in the Scheduler's buffer for a fixed time,
    the default being 15 minutes. If you are plotting a vessel's
    position using any GIS system, the vessel will remain on the GIS
    display for 15 minutes after the last position message was received
    for any given vessel.<br>
    <br>
    If you are outputting tagged fields, the value of the latest tagged
    field will be output.<br>
    <br>
    The Output Filter test is normally applied to all the data
    pertaining to the same MMSI in a block, so all the data for the one
    vessel is output or no data for the vessel is output.<br>
    <br>
    This behaviour causes a problem if a log file, with no time stamps,
    is processed by the Scheduler because all the messages for the same
    MMSI will appear to have been received at the same time. The result
    is only the last message will actually be output. This behaviour can
    be changed by unticking the <a href="OptionsTags.html">MMSI change</a>
    box, so all complete messages are processed individually, even for
    the same MMSI.<br>
