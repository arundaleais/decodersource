<h3>Network Data Input</h3>
<br>
The Network Protocol must be UDP or TCP.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="pics/ais_decoder_v3_options_input.gif"><br>
If UDP only the Port number on which you are receiving UDP data is required,
the data may be arriving from more than one host. There is no communication
from your PC to the host(s) sending the data.<br>
<br>
If TCP a Port and a Host must be set, as your PC will be communicating to the
Host sending the data, to verify the data has been received correctly. The TCP
Host can be either an IP address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) or a Name (any.server.com).
If you use a name, the name will be resolved to an IP address by any DNS server
available to your PC. Normally this will be the DNS server you have set up when
you configured your internet connection to your ISP.<br>
<br>
If you are receiving input from an AIS Network Receiver, consult your receiver
manual on how to set up an output port on your receiver. The input port on
AisDecoder must be the same port number.<br>
<br>
If you are receiving network data from the internet, the port number must be
the same as is being sent by the Server supplying you the data.<br>
<br>
If you are receiving UDP data direct from your PC, for example from another
program (eg ShipPlotter), the other program should be set up to send UDP data
to IP address 127.0.0.1 This IP address is always the local PC (even if your PC
has another IP address on the Local Newtwork) The port numbers must be the same
on both programs.<br>
<br>
If you are receiving data from a different PC on your Local network, the Server
PC will send the data to the Local IP address of the PC receiving the data.
