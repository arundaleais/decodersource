    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Format</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">determines whether the logged NMEA
        sentences have a time stamp appended to the sentence. All incoming
        sentences have a UTC time stamp (obtained from the PC's clock)
        appended, as the scheduler needs to know when the sentence was
        received.  If NMEA only is selected, this time stamp is removed prior
        to being written out to the log file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rollover</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Messages are appended to the log file
        (nmea.log) as they are received. This is NOT reset each time you start
        the decoder, so the file can get very large. If you wish you can have
        the log file "Roll Over" to a new file at midnight every day. If you
        select Log File Rollover, the log file will be named nmea_yyyymmdd.log,
        where yyyymmdd is the current Year, Month, and Day</td>

See <a
href="file:///E:/My%20Documents/ais/DecoderSource/Help/FilesandDirectories.html">Files
and Directories</a> to find the absolute location of all files<br>
<br>
If the <a href="ControlStatsWindow.html#Input_Source">Input Source</a> to the
decoder is a file, the Log File Source must be Processed or Filtered for any
output as no data will actually be Received.<br>
<br>
If the Input Source is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> a file, the
log file name will be nmea.log and will be output in the \Logs folder<br>
<br>
If the Input Source is a file, the log file name will be the same as the input
file with .log appended and will be output to the same folder as the input
file.<br>
