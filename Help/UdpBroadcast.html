<p>If you wish to send an AIS data stream to to different devices (eg PC's)
that co-exist on the same local network, the simplest way is to set the output
IP address of device outputting the data to the broadcast address of the local
network.</p>

<p>For example if the local network IP address is 192.168.1.xxx (where xxx is
the host - which may have been set automatically by DHCP), the broadcast host
IP is always .255, so the full IP address will be 192.168.1.255</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can check the current device's IP address by getting a Command prompt
and typing IPCONFIG then return</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the current device's IP address is 192.168.1.6 and the subnet mask is
255.255.255.0 the local network will be 192.168.1.xxx and the broadcast address
will be 192.168.1.255</p>

<p></p>

<p>All devices on the local network will see all data that has been sent to the
Broadcast address.</p>

<p>So all devices in the range 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 will receive the
data simultaneously.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Sender and Receiver's port must be the same on all devices, in effect
this is the channel that is being used. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Note this will only work with UDP data and NOT with TCP data because TCP
uses handshaking between sender and receiver (like a phone call) whereas UDP is
connectionless (like a radio or TV signal).</p>

<p></p>

<p>If your AIS data stream cannot be set to UDP with a broadcast address (.255)
then you can use NmeaRouter to convert the data stream to a broadcast data
stream.</p>
