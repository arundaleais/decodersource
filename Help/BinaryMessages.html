    <h3>Binary Messages<br>
    </h3>
    The International Binary Messages are still evolving, all the common
    ones I believe I have decoded.&nbsp; St Lawrence Seaway, Inland
    Waterways and most ITU/IMO will be decoded by the program. To see
    which, <a
      href="http://arundale.com/docs/ais/ais_decoder_binary.html">click
      here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Many binary messages are subject to local interpretation.
    Potentially there are many thousands of different binary messages
    possible. I have decoded many of the more common ones, where I can
    find the requisite information. If you have details of any of the
    DAC/FI messages types where I do not display at least some of the
    information, I would be pleased to receive more details.<br>
    <br>
    The format of binary messages are becoming more complex and because
    they have to be individually programmed, some can take a
    considerable time to program the decode. If you have a specific
    requirement for an as yet undecoded message, please let me know.<br>
