    <h3>Vessel Names<br>
    </h3>
    AisDecoder will extract the vessel name for all AIS messages
    received which may contain the vessel name - even if the message
    containing the vessel name is excluded by the input filter.<br>
    <br>
    The vessel name list is re-started each time the Decoder is started
    and is updated every time a message containing the vessel name is
    received. This ensures the vessel name you see is the name that is
    currently being transmitted.<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
    </div>
    If you require the vessel name on every CSV or Tagged output (and
    you probably will), you must tag the vessel name that is displayed
    next to the Vessel Name in bold, immediately before AIS Message Type
    on every Detail AIS message type you select for other field tags.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
        src="pics/ais_decoder_v3_detail_vessel.gif"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This vessel name is displayed on every AIS message detail, if it has
    been received, including other AIS message types.<br>
    <br>
    Do not Tag the second Vessel Name (not in bold) on the static data
    message (AIS message type 5), unless you <b>only</b> want the
    vessel name outputting when AIS message type 5 is output.<br>
