    <h3>USB Data Input</h3>
    <br>
    If your PC does not have a serial port, or your AIS receiver outputs
    USB data, you PC will be receiving the incoming data via USB.<br>
    <br>
    If you have had to use a Serial to USB adaptor, the adaptor will
    have
    come with a USB Driver.<br>
    <br>
    Otherwise your USB AIS Receiver will have come with a USB Driver.<br>
    <br>
    USB Drivers are individual to the hardware device plugged into the
    USB
    port on your PC, they are extremely unlikely to be interchangeable.<br>
    <br>
    The USB driver will make the output from the USB port on the PC
    appear
    to the PC as though the data is being received from a COM port. This
    is
    called a Virtual COM Port, because the COM port does not physically
    exist on the PC.<br>
    <br>
    After you have plugged the USB device (Receiver of Serial.USB
    adaptor)
    into your PC you will set up a COM Port, for example COM12.<br>
    <br>
    Having set up this Virtual COM Port, you must configure the <a
      href="SerialInput.html">Serial</a> Port on AisDecoder to the same
    port
    number.<br>
