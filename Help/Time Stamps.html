    Because there is no global standard for Time Stamping NMEA messages,
    a number of different systems are being used to both position a time
    stamp within an NMEA data stream as well as the actual format of the
    time stamp itself.
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Time Stamp Format<br>
      </b> There are 2 fundamental formats </p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plain Date/Time eg <b>3 September 2013
        11:22:33</b> This could be in any acceptable local format <b>3/9/13
        11:22:33</b> (European) <b>9/3/13 11:22:33</b> (American) <b>20130903
        112233</b> (Maritime)</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unix format eg <b>1382564803</b> This is
      the number of seconds past <strong><font face="Courier New,
          monospace">1-Jan-1970</font></strong></p>
    <p>In addition there is potential confusion if Local Time rather
      than UTC is used for the displayed Date/Time <br>

    <p><b>Time Stamp Processing by AisDecoder</b> <br>
    </p>
    <p>The Time Stamp is displayed as the Received Time UTC. AisDecoder
      attempts to identify a time stamp included in the NMEA AIS
      sentence, in the following order. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the Comment Block</li>
      <li>From a NMEA sentence Prefix
        <ol>
          <li>Using a date formatted using the Windows Locale of the PC</li>
          <li>A Numeric date in Unix time (Format 3 above)</li>
          <li>Using the proprietry Format 7 above</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>From the last word added after the CRC check
        <ol>
          <li>Using a date formatted using the Windows Locale of the PC
            (Format 2 above)</li>
          <li>A Numeric date in Unix time (Format 6 above)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Using the Current UTC date/time assuming the Windows Locale of
        the users PC</li>
    </ol>
    If the data is networked across time zones this will be the time the
    data is received by the PC.
    <p></p>
    The Locale of the PC is used to (for example) differentiate between
    American and European date formatting (2/7/14 – 2nd July or February
    7th ?). <br>
    <br>
    <b>Background to AIS Time Stamping</b><br>
    <boverview>&lt; b=""&gt; AIS was developed purely for Collision
      Avoidance at Sea, and became mandatory as part of the SOLAS
      (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations which through the IMO
      (International Maritime Organisation) regulate world wide all
      vessels at sea.<br>
      As such AIS is a real time system, supplementing radar. It was
      never intended to be used for monitoring and tracking, therefore
      it does not contain any built in time stamp. The CURRENT position
      of other vessels in immediate proximity of Own Ship is the only
      relevant data.<br>
      <br>
      It is only users that are trying to use AIS data for purposes
      other than it's prime purpose of Collision Avoidance that are
      looking for TimeStamps.<br>
      <br>
      Time Stamps are normally added when a user receives data broadcast
      by a AIS transponder on a vessel. There is no standard as to how
      this time stamp is added, it is up to individual manufacturers to
      decided how (in their receivers) they wish to time stamp the data
      received.<br>
      <br>
      Note: the Seconds in some AIS message fields is not a time stamp.
      It is used to organise the transmission of AIS data from the
      various vessels within range of one another without each vessel
      transmitting data at the same time. Many position reports do not
      contain this field, it depends on the state the transponder is in
      when it wished to transmit data. If you wish for a more detailed
      explanation see ITU R-REC-M.1371.<br>
      <br>
      To build a pathway of vessels' positions you need accurate time
      stamping added by the AIS receiver. In the case of satellite data,
      the satellite is the receiver so you have to go with the satellite
      provider’s method of time stamping. If you were receiving
      real-time data you could add the time stamp yourself, but as
      satellite data from all AIS satellites presently in use has to be
      download in batches when the satellite is in range of a ground
      station, so the basic time stamping must be done by the receiver
      in the satellite.<br>
      <br>
      Comment Blocks are a relatively new addition to the NMEA
      specification - they are NEVER transmitted, the receiver has to
      add a comment block.<br>
      Very few receivers will be adding comment blocks at the moment,
      but clearly their use is expected to grow as it is the first real
      attempt at introducing a standard way of adding time stamps.
      <p>I have also been asked numerous times - Can the time stamp
        encoded wothin some AIS messages be used. These time stamps are
        used purely by the AIS system to allocate/deallocate the slots
        used by the system, they are not complete stamps and cannot in
        practice be usefully used. They are likely to cause more
        confusion.<br>
        <br>
        Before you ask <font size="5"><b>(!)</b></font> there is no
        chance of time stamps being transmitted in the future as
        bandwidth is far more important,&nbsp; in any case a time stamp
        can always be added by the receiver rather than the transmitter.
        The time delay between transmission and reception is irrelevant.<br>

      </p>
      <p>By default AisDecoder appends a time stamp as the sentence is
        received. This time stamp is always held internally as UTC. If
        you use local time, on daylight saving time changes, you will
        either duplicate or lose a complete hour.<br>
